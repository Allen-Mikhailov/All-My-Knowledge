- A type of Extrinsic [[Semiconductor]] in which [[Donor Atoms]] are doped into the crystal lattice
- This leaves it with a ton of free negative charge carriers floating around
- [[Electrons]] are the [[Majority Charge Carriers]]
- [[Holes]] are the [[Minority Charge Carriers]]
- [[Fermi Level]] is above the [[Intrinsic Fermi Level]]
	- $$E_F > E_{Fi}$$
- Kind of opposite of [[p-type Semiconductor]]
- $$N_d>>N_a$$
- $$n_0\approx N_d$$
