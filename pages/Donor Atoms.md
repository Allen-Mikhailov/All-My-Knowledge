- A type of atom that can be doped into the crystal lattice of a [[Semiconductor]]
- They usually have like 5 valance [[Electrons]]
- 4 of the [[Electrons]] make covalent bonds with the semiconductors normal atoms
- 1 [[Electrons]]  goes free
- The Atom is now positively charged and an immobile charge carrier
