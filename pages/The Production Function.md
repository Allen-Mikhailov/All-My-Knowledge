- The relationship between the quantity of inputs used to make a good to the quantity of outputs
- Contains:
	- Number of workers
	- Output Quantity
	- Marginal Product of Labor [[Marginal Product]]
	- Fixed Cost of Capital [[Fixed Cost]]
	- Variable Cost of workers [[Variable Cost]]
	- Total Costs (=Fixed Cost + Variable Cost)
- We get diminishing returns as the curve (workers vs output) flattens
- This leads to the [[Total Cost]] curve steepening when as output increases
