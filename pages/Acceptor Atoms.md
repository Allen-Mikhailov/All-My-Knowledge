- A type of atom that can be doped into the crystal lattice of a [[Semiconductor]]
- They usually have like 3 valance [[Electrons]]s
- 3 of the [[Electrons]] make covalent bonds with the semiconductors normal atoms
- This leaves a [[Holes]]
- Becomes negatively charged and a immobile negative charge carrier
