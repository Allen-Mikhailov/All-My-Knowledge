- The point on the quantity vs costs curve in which [[Marginal Cost]] and [[Average Total Cost]] intersect
- Also the lowest point on the quantity vs [[Average Total Cost]] curve
- At this point the change in [[Average Fixed Cost]] and [[Average Variable Cost]] is the same
- To the left of this point our [[Average Fixed Cost]] is falling **faster** than our [[Average Variable Cost]] is rising
- To the right of this point our [[Average Fixed Cost]] is falling **slower** than our [[Average Variable Cost]] is rising
