- Perfectly competitive market
- Many firms selling identical products
- Sellers and buyers are price takers
- Free entry and exit into the market
-
- This means that
	- price equals [[Marginal Revenue]] and [[Average Revenue]] and [[Demand]]
	- Firm maximizes profit where  [[Marginal Cost]] equals [[Marginal Revenue]]
	- This makes their profit $$(P-ATC) \times Q$$
	- The price is the [[Marginal Revenue]] so they will produce until it equals the [[Marginal Cost]] at which point making more would loose them money
	- They also minimize losses when producing at that range
	- They will minimize losses as long as their losses are not greater than their [[Fixed Cost]] which is the same as saying that the price is above the [[Average Variable Cost]] in the short run
	- In the long run they will shut down is the [[Average Total Cost]] is greater than the price
