- Symbol: $$E_F$$
- The energy level in which the probability of an electron state being occupied is exactly 50% at thermal equilibrium
- Usually what changes in an [[Energy Band Diagram]]
- in [[p-type Semiconductor]] it is closer to $$E_V$$ (The Valence Band)
- In [[n-type Semiconductor]] it is closer to the $$E_C$$ conduction band
-
- In metals $E_F is in the conduction band (Electron Sea)
