- The voltage at which [[MOS Capacitor Inversion]] occurs.
	- In **p-type** happens when the semiconductor work function is equal to twice the [[Fermi Potential]] or $$\phi_s=2\phi_{fp}$$
	- In **n-type** happens when the semiconductor work function is equal to twice the [[Fermi Potential]] or $$\phi_s=2\phi_{fp}$$
