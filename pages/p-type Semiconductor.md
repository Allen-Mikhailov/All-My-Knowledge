- A type of Extrinsic [[Semiconductor]] in which [[Acceptor Atoms]]  are doped into the crystal lattice
- This leaves it with a ton of [[Holes]]
- [[Holes]] are the [[Majority Charge Carriers]]
- [[Electrons]] are the [[Minority Charge Carriers]]
- Kind of opposite of [[n-type Semiconductor]]
- $$N_a>>N_d$$
- $$p_0\approx N_a$$
