- MOSFETS have [[MOS Capacitor]]s in them
-
- There are 2 modes for MOSFETS
	- Enhancement Mode
	- Depletion Mode
- There are also type types they can be
	- PMOS with a [[p-type Semiconductor]] as the top part and n-type for the bulk
	- NMOS with an [[n-type Semiconductor]] as the top part and p-type for the bulk
-
- There are two regions for current
	- Linear Region where the current increased linearly with voltage $$V_{DS}<V_{DS}(sat)$$
		- Current: $$I_D=\frac{W\mu_n C_{ox}}{2L}$$
	- Saturation region where the current maxes out  $$V_{DS}>V_{DS}(sat)$$
- I-V characteristic of n-type enhancement
