- Also known as  depletion region
- When there is no bias (no external voltage/thermal equilibrium ) there are no [[Majority Charge Carriers]]
- The n-side has a net positive charge due to the $$N_d^+$$ ions
- the p-side has a net negative charge due to the $$N_d^- $$ ions
- The n-side width is $$x_n$$ and the p-sides width is $$x_p$$. The width of this region is $$W=x_n+x_p$$
