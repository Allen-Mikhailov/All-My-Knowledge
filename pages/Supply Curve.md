- Price vs Quantity
- In the short run it is just the [[Marginal Cost]] curve just for all firms
- In the long run the curve becomes perfectly elastic (flat)
	- Profit becomes zero
	- This happens when the Price,  [[Average Total Cost]], [[Marginal Cost]], [[Average Revenue]], and [[Marginal Revenue]] are equal
	- Formula: $$P=ATC=MC=AR=MR$$
	- Firms have no incentive to enter or exit
	- If there is profit to be made then more firms will enter
	- If there are only losses then firms will leave the market
- We produce were [[Marginal Revenue]] equals [[Marginal Cost]]
